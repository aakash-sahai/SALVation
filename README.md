Simple Autonomous Land Vehicle loco-automation

SALVation project is an attempt to build a **Simple** control software for controlling an **Autonomous Land Vehicle**. We are striving to build a simple to use hobbyist platform for controlling off-the-shelf RC vehicle using inexpensive embedded hardware platforms like Arduino.

There are other projects like this with far more ambitious goals. The goal of this project is simplicity first. We want to build a platform that can be used by middle/high school students and serious hobbyists alike. The "simplicity first" mantra does not refer to the simplicity of functionality, but rather simplicity of use. We want to build a modular platform whereby even novice users can quickly master the basics to build a functional Autonomous Land Vehicle using stock hardware. At the same time, the serious and experienced users can leverage modules complex real-time schedulers, tunable PID algorithms, Kalman filters and like to build sophisticated control algorithms for ALV.

You are welcome to join the community, enjoy the the fruits of our labor, and contribute to the success of this project by volunteering your expertise. The code is and will always remain FOSS and distributed under the AGPL v3 license. The examples and documentation will be distributed under the Creative Commons license.
